# Weaponize

This project is a Minecraft Datapack seeking to overhaul the Minecraft combat system by adding a wide variety of new weapons and, more importantly, weapon styles - giving a wide array of options for combat.
It is currently in Alpha.

Do note that this pack relies on the m.util library, available here: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/m-util/
